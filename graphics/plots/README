There are various types of plots produced by the code in this directory.
Before plots are created, ensure model output data has been reduced using the analysis code in ../reduce.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
2D positions

Black bakground, coloured points of different sizes
 - All 3 projections on one plot: 2Dpositions_pretty_all.r
 - Plot one projection (defined in code): 2Dpositions_pretty.r

White background, 'object' stars in red with others in grey
 - As above: 2Dpositions_sciencey.r
 - Plots showing MST edges: 2Dpositions_sciencey_mst.r


-------------------------------------------------------------------
3D positions

Black background, coloured points of different sizes (3Dpositions_pretty.r)
White background, 'object' stars in red with vertical lines to xy plane


-------------------------------------------------------------------
In plots,
> python makeplots.py
Plots energy, virial ratio, half-mass radius as function of time (can skip)
Plots lambdas:
      comparison between projections (lambdaprojections)
      difference betwee each 2D projection & 3D (projectioncompare)
      comparison of different lambdas (lambdacompare)
      comparison across k (lambda_k)

Edits to code for lambda plots made on 17/01/2018 for compatibility with matplotlib 2.0.
