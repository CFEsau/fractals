Analysis code for cluster evolution calculated using Kira.

User inputs location of simulation data (the runinv file)
and desired location of outputs (e.g. ../outputs)

Structure of outputs: runinv_k##/cluster_(type)/(text files)
'type' is all, FoV, or rhalf.
Text files:

 distances_[proj].dat:
      |	snapi |    c of m    |  half-mass radius |
      |	      | xy | yz | xz |        (3D)       |
      	        |    |    |             |
      	        |    |    |             |
                V    V    V             V
  All 3 dimensions are used for these data. The 'proj' part
  of the filename states which projection is used when defining
  the cluster, e.g. if star 1 has coordinates (1, 2, 6) pc and
  the cluster is defined as all stars within a 5 pc Fov then
  this will be included in data for the distances_xy file but
  not _yz or _xz data.

 escaped_[proj].dat:
      Gives cumulative # of stars escaped in each snapshot.
      | star ID | distance magnitude | star mass

 lambda_[proj].dat
      | snapi | Lambda bar | + | - | Lambda tilde | + | - |
      | Lambda * | + | - | Lambda tilde | + | - | Gamma | + | - |

 objm_[proj].dat
      Masses of the nmst object stars for each snapshot.
      Data is written out when these values change,
      i.e. for snapshots when an object star has been ejected.
